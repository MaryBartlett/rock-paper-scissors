# rock-paper-scissors

Built using [generator-angular-webpack-babel](https://github.com/Aleksion/generator-angular-webpack-babel) and [this article explaining how best to use this angular ES6 webpack template](http://angular-tips.com/blog/2015/06/using-angular-1-dot-x-with-es6-and-webpack/)


### Scripts


All scripts are run with `npm run [script]`, for example: `npm run test`.

* `build` - will run both build:module and build:dist
* `build:dist` - will build and minify the app to the dist folder with dependencies,
* `build:module`- will build and minify the app to the lib folder. This is for usage as a module in other applications. Without dependencies.
* `serve` - start development server with local configuration, try it by opening `http://localhost:8080/` or the browserSync version at `http://localhost:3000/``
* `serve:dev` - development server with development configuration
* `serve:prod`- development server with production configuration
* `test` - run all tests
* `test:live` - continuously run unit tests watching for changes

See what each script does by looking at the `scripts` section in [package.json](./package.json).


#### Images


Images for rock paper scissors were used from [Curiosa Mathematica](http://curiosamathematica.tumblr.com/image/78536951883) with no prior permission. 


### Comments about the the webpack generator


Images don't seem to load - they don't webpack up and I spent some time trying to find out why, but that wasn't the point of this exercise so I've inlined SVGs as a workaround. The suggestion in the webpack conf is that they will get copied to dist but they don't.

Flow seems a bit like overkill, I've not run into any problems due to it but it (and many other things in this project) are probably unnecessary for a small learning project.


### What I've not done


This definitely needs someone with an eye for design making it, it's far from pretty!

I've not tested this cross browser - just Chrome on Linux.

Ideally you'd have a reset file to reset all the browsers back to a common point. I've not got this so expect some variation between browsers.
